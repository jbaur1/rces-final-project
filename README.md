Project Description:

This project aims to derive and analyze the velocity of a lava flow site at Fissure 8 from the 2018 Lower East Rift Zone of Kilauea in Hawaii,  from drone imagery collected by the USGS. This research is part of a larger project to understand and model multi-phase (lava, bubbles, and crystals) lava flows, and ultimatley better predict lava flow emplacement. I have derived velocity vector fields using particle image velocimetry (PIV), and analyze these data in xarray. 


Scientific Questions:

How does lava flow velocity at Site 4 change throughout a day?
Understaning how the flow geometry, and it's affect on velocity
   -influence of flow width, and depth on the apparent velocity?
